# Qubit
Qubit is part of the Alchemical DFT project. It aims to provide a toolkit that can be used to assist in chemical machine learning or deep learning.

It was built by Michiel Jacobs in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Science in Chemistry at the ALGC research group of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel under promotorship of Prof. Dr. Ir. Freija De Vleeschouwer.
